<p class="arsenal-sc-regular"><b>The sweet cold after the rain made Georg crave a cup of tea even in his half sleep state, and light broke
through dark clouds and the gaps between curtains. He twisted his midriff and woke up. But something was very
unusual. The room didn’t seem like his own, neither anyone’s he’d ever been in. Being still on his back, he
decided to sleep a little longer. But he couldn’t sleep. He was tired of sleeping. He could interpret his body,
and he knew he’d been sleeping for days or possibly years. He woke up, eyes wide open, pushed
himself out of the sack-like curtain. The light burst into his eyes, yet he could turn his body to see the
blurry tiny cabin dangling to a branch. He - now his vision and mind being clear and stable - could see the silky
orange and black part of his body, which he had total control of and of which he thought his blanket all along,
flapped and flapped to keep him afloat. It was his wings. He had turned into the Red Admiral.</b></p>

  <h3 class="fontsetting"><b>Three Shadows</b></h3>
  <p class="arsenal-sc-regular"><b>When you sleep <br>
  You have three shadows <br>
  One goes to collect war debris <br>
  Another goes to bury stars <br>
  And the loneliest one watches you and wonders how beautiful it could’ve been if it had colors
